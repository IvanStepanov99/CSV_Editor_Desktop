## **CSV file Reader Desktop Version**
The project allows to perform minor math operations with data in your CSV file, and extend the existed data.
Desktop version: The main interface of the app provides five input fields where users can enter financial data: Income, Expenses, Debt/Loan, Interest, and Loan Type. Each field is accompanied by a label that clearly indicates what information needs to be entered. Once the data is filled in, users can click the Submit Data button to save the data into a CSV file. If any of the required fields are left blank, the app will prompt the user to fill in all fields before proceeding.

Additionally, there are several Calculation Buttons that allow users to perform various financial calculations. These include the Total of Income, Total of Expenses, Net Income, Total of Debt/Loan, and APR. The results of these calculations are displayed at the bottom of the interface, providing users with quick insights into their financial data.
